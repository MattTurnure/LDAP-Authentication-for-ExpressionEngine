##  LDAP Authentication for ExpressionEngine ##
An ExpressionEngine Extension that allows the authentication of users via LDAP. LDAP details are copied to the EE database before standard MySQL authentication is performed. If user is not found on LDAP, MySQL authentication will still be performed (useful for EE users not in LDAP)

Available in both EE1 and EE2 versions.

## Installation ##

Choose EE1 or EE2 (depending on your installation).
Use the structure provided to place the files within your current EE installation.
Enable the extension in your EE control panel.
